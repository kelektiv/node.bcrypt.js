=============

Lib to help you hash passwords.

Security Issues/Concerns
=============

As should be the case with any security tool, this library should be scrutinized by anyone using it. If you find or suspect an issue with the code- please bring it to my attention and I'll spend some time trying to make sure that this tool is as secure as possible.

To make it easier for people using this tool to analyze what has been surveyed, here is a list of BCrypt related security issues/concerns as they've come up.

* [GH-13][gh13] - There was a timing attack present in the comparator. This is fixed in versions higher than 0.2.1, but I recommend using 0.2.3 (code fixes) or later. HT [thegoleffect][thegoleffect].
* An [issue with passwords][jtr] was found with a version of the Blowfish algorithm developed for John the Ripper. This is not present in the OpenBSD version and is thus not a problem for this module. HT [zooko][zooko].

Dependencies
=============

* NodeJS
* OpenSSL

From NPM
============

npm install bcrypt


From Source
============

Assuming you've already built node, you can run the waf script:  

    node-waf configure
    node-waf build
    npm link

Usage - Sync
============

To hash a password:  

    var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');  
    var salt = bcrypt.gen_salt_sync(10);  
    var hash = bcrypt.encrypt_sync("B4c0/\/", salt);

To check a password:  

    var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');  
    var salt = bcrypt.gen_salt_sync(10);  
    var hash = bcrypt.encrypt_sync("B4c0/\/", salt);
    bcrypt.compare_sync("B4c0/\/", hash); // true    
    bcrypt.compare_sync("not_bacon", hash); // false

Usage - Async
============

To hash a password:  

    var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');  
    bcrypt.gen_salt(10, function(err, salt) {
        bcrypt.encrypt("B4c0/\/", salt, function(err, hash) {
            //something
        });
    });

To check a password:  

    var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
    bcrypt.gen_salt(10, function(err, salt) {
        bcrypt.encrypt("B4c0/\/", salt, function(err, hash) {
            bcrypt.compare("B4c0/\/", hash, function(err, res) {
                // res == true    
            });
            bcrypt.compare("not_bacon", hash, function(err, res) {
                // res = false
            });
        });
    });

API
============

`BCrypt.`

  * `gen_salt_sync(rounds, seed_length)`
    * `rounds` - [OPTIONAL] - the number of rounds to process the data for. (default - 10)
    * `seed_length` - [OPTIONAL] - RAND_bytes wants a length. to make that a bit flexible, you can specify a seed_length. (default - 20)
  * `gen_salt(rounds, seed_length, cb)`
    * `rounds` - [OPTIONAL] - the number of rounds to process the data for. (default - 10)
    * `seed_length` - [OPTIONAL] - RAND_bytes wants a length. to make that a bit flexible, you can specify a seed_length. (default - 20)
    * `cb` - [REQUIRED] - a callback to be fired once the salt has been generated. uses eio making it asynchronous.
  * `encrypt_sync(data, salt)`
    * `data` - [REQUIRED] - the data to be encrypted.
    * `salt` - [REQUIRED] - the salt to be used in encryption.
  * `encrypt(data, salt, cb)`
    * `data` - [REQUIRED] - the data to be encrypted.
    * `salt` - [REQUIRED] - the salt to be used in encryption.
    * `cb` - [REQUIRED] - a callback to be fired once the data has been encrypted. uses eio making it asynchronous.
  * `compare_sync(data, encrypted)`
    * `data` - [REQUIRED] - data to compare.
    * `encrypted` - [REQUIRED] - data to be compared to.
  * `compare(data, encrypted, cb)`
    * `data` - [REQUIRED] - data to compare.
    * `encrypted` - [REQUIRED] - data to be compared to.
    * `cb` - [REQUIRED] - a callback to be fired once the data has been compared. uses eio making it asynchronous.

Hash Info
============

The characters that comprise the resultant hash are `./ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789$`.

Testing
============

I am using nodeunit. I like the way you write tests with it and I like the default output. As such you'll need it to run the tests. I suspect my tests would run on an older version, but these were written and worked against 0.5.1

    npm install nodeunit@0.5.1
    nodeunit test/
