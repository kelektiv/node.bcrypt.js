## If You Are Submitting Bugs/Issues

First, make sure that the version of node you are using is a _stable_ version. You'll know this because it'll have an even major release number. We do not currently support unstable versions and while the module may happen to work on some unstable versions you'll find that we quickly close issues if you're not using a stable version.

If you are on a stable version of node, we can't magically know what you are doing to expose an issue, it is best if you provide a snippet of code or log files if you're having an install issue. This snippet need not include your secret sauce, but it must replicate the issue you are describing. The issues that get closed without resolution tend to be the ones that don't help us help you. Thanks.


## Version Compatibility

| Node Version | Bcrypt Version |
| ---- | ---- |
| 0.4.x | <= 0.4.x |
| 0.6.x | >= 0.5.x |
| 0.8.x | >= 0.5.x |
| 0.10.x | >= 0.5.x |
| 0.11.x | >= 0.8.x |
| 4.x.x | <= 2.0.x |
| 8.x.x | >= 1.0.3 |
| 10.x.x | >= 3.0.0 |

`node-gyp` only works with stable/released versions of node. Since the `bcrypt` module uses `node-gyp` to build and install you'll need a stable version of node to use bcrypt. If you do not you'll likely see an error that starts with:

```
gyp ERR! stack Error: "pre" versions of node cannot be installed, use the --nodedir flag instead
```

## Security Issues/Concerns

> Per bcrypt implementation, only the first 72 characters of a string are used. Any extra characters are ignored when matching passwords.

As should be the case with any security tool, this library should be scrutinized by anyone using it. If you find or suspect an issue with the code- please bring it to my attention and I'll spend some time trying to make sure that this tool is as secure as possible.

To make it easier for people using this tool to analyze what has been surveyed, here is a list of BCrypt related security issues/concerns as they've come up.

* An [issue with passwords][jtr] was found with a version of the Blowfish algorithm developed for John the Ripper. This is not present in the OpenBSD version and is thus not a problem for this module. HT [zooko][zooko].

## Compatibility Note

This library supports `$2a$` and `$2b$` prefix bcrypt hashes. `$2x$` and `$2y$` hashes are specific to bcrypt implementation developed for Jon the Ripper. In theory, they should be compatible with `$2b$` prefix.

Compatibility with hashes generated by other languages is not 100% guaranteed due to difference in character encodings. However, it should not be an issue for most cases.

### Migrating from v1.0.x

Hashes generated in earlier version of `bcrypt` remain 100% supported in `v2.x.x` and later versions. In most cases, the migration should be a bump in the `package.json`.

Hashes generated in `v2.x.x` using the defaults parameters will not work in earlier versions.

## Dependencies

* NodeJS
* `node-gyp`
 * Please check the dependencies for this tool at: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp
  * Windows users will need the options for c# and c++ installed with their visual studio instance.
  * Python 2.x
* `OpenSSL` - This is only required to build the `bcrypt` project if you are using versions <= 0.7.7. Otherwise, we're using the builtin node crypto bindings for seed data (which use the same OpenSSL code paths we were, but don't have the external dependency).

## Install via NPM

```
npm install bcrypt
```
***Note:*** OS X users using Xcode 4.3.1 or above may need to run the following command in their terminal prior to installing if errors occur regarding xcodebuild: ```sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer```

_Pre-built binaries for various NodeJS versions are made available on a best-effort basis._

Only the current stable and the supported LTS releases are actively tested against. Please note that there may be an interval between the release of the module and the availabilty of the compiled modules.

Currently, we have pre-built binaries that support the following platforms:

1. Windows x32 and x64
2. Linux x64 (GlibC targets only). Pre-built binaries for MUSL targets such as Apline Linux are not available.
3. macOS

If you face an error like this:

```
node-pre-gyp ERR! Tried to download(404): https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/releases/download/v1.0.2/bcrypt_lib-v1.0.2-node-v48-linux-x64.tar.gz
```

Make sure you have the appropriate dependencies installed and configured for your platform. You can find installation instructions for the dependencies for some common platforms [in this page][depsinstall].

## Usage

### async (recommended)

```javascript
var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const saltRounds = 10;
const myPlaintextPassword = 's0/\/\P4$$w0rD';
const someOtherPlaintextPassword = 'not_bacon';
```

#### To hash a password:

Technique 1 (generate a salt and hash on separate function calls):

```javascript
bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds, function(err, salt) {
    bcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, salt, function(err, hash) {
        // Store hash in your password DB.
    });
});
```

Technique 2 (auto-gen a salt and hash):

```javascript
bcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds, function(err, hash) {
  // Store hash in your password DB.
});
```

Note that both techniques achieve the same end-result.

#### To check a password:

```javascript
// Load hash from your password DB.
bcrypt.compare(myPlaintextPassword, hash, function(err, res) {
    // res == true
});
bcrypt.compare(someOtherPlaintextPassword, hash, function(err, res) {
    // res == false
});
```

The "compare" function counters timing attacks (using a so-called 'constant-time' algorithm).
In general, don't use the normal JavaScript string comparison functions to compare passwords,
cryptographic keys, or cryptographic hashes if they are relevant to security.

### with promises

bcrypt uses whatever Promise implementation is available in `global.Promise`. NodeJS >= 0.12 has a native Promise implementation built in. However, this should work in any Promises/A+ compliant implementation.

Async methods that accept a callback, return a `Promise` when callback is not specified if Promise support is available.

```javascript
bcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds).then(function(hash) {
    // Store hash in your password DB.
});
```
```javascript
// Load hash from your password DB.
bcrypt.compare(myPlaintextPassword, hash).then(function(res) {
    // res == true
});
bcrypt.compare(someOtherPlaintextPassword, hash).then(function(res) {
    // res == false
});
```

This is also compatible with `async/await`

```javascript
async function checkUser(username, password) {
    //... fetch user from a db etc.

    const match = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash);

    if(match) {
        //login
    }

    //...
}
```

### sync

```javascript
var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const saltRounds = 10;
const myPlaintextPassword = 's0/\/\P4$$w0rD';
const someOtherPlaintextPassword = 'not_bacon';
```

#### To hash a password:

Technique 1 (generate a salt and hash on separate function calls):

```javascript
var salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync(saltRounds);
var hash = bcrypt.hashSync(myPlaintextPassword, salt);
// Store hash in your password DB.
```

Technique 2 (auto-gen a salt and hash):

```javascript
var hash = bcrypt.hashSync(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds);
// Store hash in your password DB.
```

As with async, both techniques achieve the same end-result.

#### To check a password:

```javascript
// Load hash from your password DB.
bcrypt.compareSync(myPlaintextPassword, hash); // true
bcrypt.compareSync(someOtherPlaintextPassword, hash); // false
```
The "compareSync" function counters timing attacks (using a so-called 'constant-time' algorithm).
In general, don't use the normal JavaScript string comparison functions to compare passwords,
cryptographic keys, or cryptographic hashes if they are relevant to security.

### Why is async mode recommended over sync mode?

If you are using bcrypt on a simple script, using the sync mode is perfectly fine. However, if you are using bcrypt on a server, the async mode is recommended. This is because the hashing done by bcrypt is CPU intensive, so the sync version will block the event loop and prevent your application from servicing any other inbound requests or events.

## API

`BCrypt.`

  * `genSaltSync(rounds, minor)`
    * `rounds` - [OPTIONAL] - the cost of processing the data. (default - 10)
    * `minor` - [OPTIONAL] - minor version of bcrypt to use. (default - b)
  * `genSalt(rounds, minor, cb)`
    * `rounds` - [OPTIONAL] - the cost of processing the data. (default - 10)

  * `hashSync(data, salt)`
    * `data` - [REQUIRED] - the data to be encrypted.
    * `salt` - [REQUIRED] - the salt to be used to hash the password. if specified as a number then a salt will be generated with the specified number of rounds and used (see example under **Usage**).
  * `hash(data, salt, cb)`
    * `data` - [REQUIRED] - the data to be encrypted.

    * `encrypted` - [REQUIRED] - hash from which the number of rounds used should be extracted.

## A Note on Rounds

A note about the cost. When you are hashing your data the module will go through a series of rounds to give you a secure hash. The value you submit there is not just the number of rounds that the module will go through to hash your data. The module will use the value you enter and go through `2^rounds` iterations of processing.

From @garthk, on a 2GHz core you can roughly expect:

    rounds=8 : ~40 hashes/sec
    rounds=9 : ~20 hashes/sec
    rounds=10: ~10 hashes/sec
    rounds=11: ~5  hashes/sec
    rounds=12: 2-3 hashes/sec
    rounds=13: ~1 sec/hash
    rounds=14: ~1.5 sec/hash
    rounds=15: ~3 sec/hash
    rounds=25: ~1 hour/hash
    rounds=31: 2-3 days/hash


## Hash Info

The characters that comprise the resultant hash are `./ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789$`.

Resultant hashes will be 60 characters long.

## Testing

If you create a pull request, tests better pass :)

```
npm install
npm test
```
